    "Boosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble. It combines a set of weak learners and delivers improved prediction accuracy. At any instant t, the model outcomes are weighed based on the outcomes of previous instant t-1. The outcomes predicted correctly are given a lower weight and the ones miss-classified are weighted higher. Note that a weak learner is one which is slightly better than random guessing. The basic idea behind boosting algorithms is building a weak model, making conclusions about the various feature importance and parameters, and then using those conclusions to build a new, stronger model and capitalize on the misclassification error of the previous model and try to reduce it. Now, let's come to XGBoost. To begin with, you should know about the default base learners of XGBoost: tree ensembles. The tree ensemble model is a set of classification and regression trees (CART). Trees are grown one after another ,and attempts to reduce the misclassification rate are made in subsequent iterations. Each tree gives a different prediction score depending on the data it sees and the scores of each individual tree are summed up to get the final score."
